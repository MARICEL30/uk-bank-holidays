# Uk bank Holidays

The purpose of this project was to build a simple web app that displays the upcoming bank holidays in the UK.

## Tools

The web app is hosted on Netlify and the domain was bought from Namecheap. This project uses the UK Gov public bank holidays API.
The project uses the tech stack I use at work such as React, Typescript and Jest for testing.

## System Design

The design systen is simple as the web app does not require authentication or expensive data resources.
However, more features may be added at a later date.

The app fetches the data from the UK Gov api and display the bank holidays dates in cards format. The user can choose
between England and wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
