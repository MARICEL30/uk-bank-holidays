# Uk bank Holidays

The purpose of this project is to build a simple web app that displays the UK upcoming bank holidays.

## Tools

The web app is going to be hosted on Netlify. This project uses the UK Gov public bank holidays API.
There is also the option of using a cloud image hosting provider to be able to fast retrieve images.

## System Design

The design systen is simple as the web app does not require authentication or expensive data resources.
However, this may be added at a later date.
