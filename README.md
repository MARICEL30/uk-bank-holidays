# Uk bank Holidays

The purpose of this project was to build a simple web app that displays the upcoming bank holidays in the UK.

## Tools

The web app is hosted on Netlify. This project uses the UK Gov public bank holidays API. The project uses the
tech stack I use at work such as React, Typescript and Jest.

## System Design

The design systen is simple as the web app does not require authentication or expensive data resources.
However, more features may be added at a later date.
